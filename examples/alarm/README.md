## Simple Alarm creation

This example is to create a simple alarm with notification topic.   
Rename the provider.tf.example to provider.tf  and provide the required values   
  
Local values are defined to test it quickly.   
If you like to create multiple alarms with a topic then rename the terraform.tfvars.example to terraform.tfvars.   

Run the terraform commands to execute 
```console
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
